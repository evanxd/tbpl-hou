# tbpl-hou
TBPL Hou lets Gaia developers get notifications when the jobs are done.

## Build
To build the project, we need to install [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) and dependent modules first.
```
npm -g install gulp
npm install
```
Then run
```
gulp build
```
to build tbpl-hou, and we could get the Firefox addon in the `~/path/to/tbpl-hou/build` folder.

## Download
* [version 0.0.1](https://evanxd.github.io/tbpl-hou/download/tbpl-hou-0.0.1.xpi) - Send the result notification once the TBPL job is done.
